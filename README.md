Hiking List Generator
===================


> **Core Concepts:**
>
>  - Lists are generated by way of a Python script which reads *Source Of Truth* files.
>  - *Source Of Truth* files are YAML formatted and reside in the **source_of_truth** directory.
>  - *Source Of Truth* files can import other source of truth files. imported source of truth files only import peaks from those *Source Of Truth* files.
>  - *Source Of Truth* files contain other metadata which dictate the behavior of the list.
>  - The Python script can generate multiple list formats at once.



All *Source Of Truth* files must contain peaks which include at a mandatory minimum the following datapoints:

- Name
- Elevation
- Latitude
- Longitude


 #### Source Of Truth (Meta)data
> - **standalone:** (true|false) dictates if this list is to be generated as a standalone when *cascading* is disabled
> - **location:** (string) indicates the location of this list. This is used for determining what output directory to place the final list into.
> - **peaks:** (list) list of peaks with required *Name, Elevation, Latitude, and Longitude.*
> - **import:** (list) list of *yml* files to import additional peaks from.
> - **max:** (int) truncate list to this number of peaks if the number of peaks exceeds that value.
> - **forced_import:** (list) when cascading is turned off, forcibly import peaks from this list of *yml* files
> - **sortby:** (string) forcibly sort this list by this column. The default is *Elevation*
