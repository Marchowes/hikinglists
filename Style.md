===================

#### Names

Names are to be formatted as such:
 > [*Main Block*][*Conditional Descriptor*][*Conditional Cardinal*][*Optional Info*]

Names are to adhere to the following standards:

> - Must be all CAPS
> - Peaks with "assumed names based on nearby geographic features" should be labeled `UNNAMED assumed name here` ex: `UNNAMED OAF POND PK` in the *Main Block* If no cardinal is added, please append `PK`
> - Peaks with nameless sub peaks, or UNNAMED peaks with sub peaks should have a `( Cardinality PK)` suffix for *Conditional Cardinal* ex:  `UNNAMED OAF POND (S PK)` or `BRAINTREE (SS PK)`
> - Peaks or sub peaks with commonly accepted names can have fully spelled out cardinality prefixes ex: `SOUTH TWIN`
> - `MT, MTN, MOUNT, PEAK` are all acceptable name portions in the *Main Block* , but only as part of the main block. Cardinality Suffixes should always be abbreviated `MT, PK`.
> - Additional descriptors (such as common alternative names) can be added in the *Optional Info* section ex: `Sawtooth (W PK) (#4)`
> - Common, but unofficial, or unverified names do not need `UNNAMED` as a prefix.


Forbidden Characters:

> Don't use these: `[, ], ', ", {, },`
> Bad: `DOMEY'S DOME` Good: `DOMEYS DOME`
> Bad: `[OWL'S HEAD]` Good: `OWLS HEAD`
>

#### Elevation

Elevation is to use `Feet` and only `Feet`. Do not use `Meters`.
If you wish to use metric units, You may add a custom Metric table.


#### Latitude and Longitude

Latitude and Longitude are to be expressed in Signed Dotted Decimal notation out to at least 3 decimal places, but no more than 8. Ideally 4 places

**Examples:**
*Someplace in the northeast US:* `44.5332`,`-73.4211`
*Someplace in the northeast US:* `44.0000`,`-73.4100`

**Do not use:**
> - UTM `566919 E 4894512 N, Zone 18`
> - H:M:S `44° 12' 3" N, 74° 9' 45" W`
> - Dotted Decimal with Cardinals `44.5332 N`, `73.4211 W`
